# SMART FARMING
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Abstract:
Agriculture is the broadest economic sector and plays an important role in the overall economic development of a nation. Technological advancements in the arena of agriculture will ascertain to increase the competence of certain farming activities. In this project, we have proposed a novel methodology for smart farming by linking a smart sensing system and smart irrigator system through wireless communication technology. Our system focuses on the measurement of physical parameters such as soil moisture content, nutrient content, that plays a vital role in farming activities. Based on the essential physical and chemical parameters of the soil measured, the required quantity of green manure, compost, and water is splashed on the crops using a smart irrigator, which is mounted on a movable overhead crane system.

# Introduction:

"Smart farming" is an emerging concept that refers to managing farms using technologies like IoT, robotics, drones and AI to increase the quantity and quality of products while optimizing the human labor required by production.Traditionally farming as a practice has been in the past and will continue in the future to be a manual and labor-intensive industry. With technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Big data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) touching almost all the listed industry sectors know. 
Smart farming is a fairly new term and the majority of farmers are not familiar with what exactly stands behind it. In this post we will shed light onto the concept of smart agriculture and why it is the future of farming. Next posts on our blog will dive deeper into the benefits of using smart agriculture for your farms.
The connection between all these technologies is the Internet of Things – this is a mechanism for connectivity between sensors and machines, resulting in a complex system that manages your farm based on data received.farmers can monitor the processes on their farms and take strategic decisions remotely – from their tablet, phone or other mobile device – without being on the open fields, in their greenhouse, orchard, vineyard, etc.

# Description:

# STM32
The STM32F4 Discovery board is small devices based on STMF407 ARM microcontroller, which is a high-performance microcontroller. This board allows users to develop and design applications. It has multiple modules within itself which allows the user to communicate and design the interface of different kinds without relying on any third device.

# Arduino board UNO:
Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects. This board can be interfaced with other Arduino boards, Arduino shields, Raspberry Pi boards and can control relays, LEDs, servos, and motors as an output.

Arduino UNO features AVR microcontroller Atmega328, 6 analogue input pins, and 14 digital I/O pins out of which 6 are used as PWM output.

# Ultra Sonic sensor:
An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter (which emits the sound using piezoelectric crystals) and the receiver (which encounters the sound after it has travelled to and from the target).

# Resistor:
A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.

# LED:
Light-emitting diode (LED) is a widely used standard source of light in electrical equipment. It has a wide range of applications ranging from your mobile phone to large advertising billboards. They mostly find applications in devices that show the time and display different types of data.

# Bread board:
A breadboard, or protoboard, is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. Originally the word referred to a literal bread board, a polished piece of wood used when slicing bread.In the 1970s the solderless breadboard ( plugboard, a terminal array board) became available and nowadays the term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to these.

# Soil moisture sensor:
Soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of free soil moisture requires removing, drying, and weighing of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other property of the soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, as a proxy for the moisture content.
